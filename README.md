# Portfolio

2/24/2022

Today marks the beginning of my Portfolio build. I have started with an attempt at a simple outline and the addition of a few photos. \
Currently I have a nav bar that directs you to different section that exist on my home-page. In some of the sections there is just information, i.e. the "About Me" section, and some of the sections include links to additional pages, i.e. "Interests" and "Resume." The "Social Media" section will only include links to my Github and YouTube page. 

Tomorrow i plan to fill out my "Interests" and "Resume" pages. As well as, start the process of adding a "Contact" page.

I have had a little trouble today getting things lined up properly and I dont entirely understand how to make things mobile compatible,  but i hope to have clear questions for my support staff and classmates tomorrow.
