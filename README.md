# Portfolio

2/24/2022

Today marks the beginning of my Portfolio build. I have started with an attempt at a simple outline and the addition of a few photos. \
Currently I have a nav bar that directs you to different section that exist on my home-page. In some of the sections there is just information, i.e. the "About Me" section, and some of the sections include links to additional pages, i.e. "Interests" and "Resume." The "Social Media" section will only include links to my Github and YouTube page. 

Tomorrow i plan to fill out my "Interests" and "Resume" pages. As well as, start the process of adding a "Contact" page.

I have had a little trouble today getting things lined up properly and I dont entirely understand how to make things mobile compatible,  but i hope to have clear questions for my support staff and classmates tomorrow.

Today is day two of my portfolio build. I have spent most of the morning/early afternoon perfecting my home page layout, while also making small changes to the format of my nav bar. I think i'm satisfied with the layout of the page, but i do have some work to do on the nav bar.

I am going to spend the rest of the afternoon/evening working on the "Interests" and "Resume" pages.

Today is day three of my portfolio build. I am committed to my layout now since I am basically halfway through my alotted time for this assignment. I think i have the basic structure of my home page how i would like it to look. I have filled out my "Interests" page and will spend this afternoon getting the "Resume" complete. 

I have had a bit of a hang up with my nav bar, but have a solution that is working as a place holder until I can get to class Monday to collab with some fellow students to make the bar move with the scroll.

Today is day four of my porfolio build. I have made some adjustments to my navbar/logo layout and I am much happier with how it looks/functions now. I plan to spend my Sunday debugging a couple small things regarding its functionality on the home page. 

I need to finish my Resume, Social Media, and Contact pages. 

The Contact page will most likely be my only point of
