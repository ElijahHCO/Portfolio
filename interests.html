            <p class="interests-snowboarding-text">I have snowboarded for 4 years now. I moved to Steamboat Springs, CO
                just so i could learn to snowboard
                in fact. What was originally suppossed to be one winter season, quickly turned into 4 years in the boat.
                I cannot say enough how important it is for me to get on the hill as many times as possible in a winter
                season.</p>

            <p class="interests-photography-text">Photography is something i picked up within the last two years. I have
                always been interested in pictures and cameras, but could not afford my own gear. I now operate with a
                Sony A6600. I also love the GoPro Hero 9 for the snowboarding and action film. </p>
