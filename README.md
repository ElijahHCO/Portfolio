Today marks the beginning of my Portfolio build. I have started with an attempt at a simple outline and the addition of a few photos. 
Currently I have a nav bar that directs you to different section that exist on my home-page. In some of the sections there is just information, i.e. the "About Me" section, and some of the sections include links to additional pages, i.e. "Interests" and "Resume." The "Social Media" section will only include links to my Github and YouTube page. 

Tomorrow i plan to fill out my "Interests" and "Resume" pages. As well as, start the process of adding a "Contact" page.

I have had a little trouble today getting things lined up properly and I dont entirely understand how to make things mobile compatible,  but i hope to have clear questions for my support staff and classmates tomorrow.

Today is day two of my portfolio build. I have spent most of the morning/early afternoon perfecting my home page layout, while also making small changes to the format of my nav bar. I think i'm satisfied with the layout of the page, but i do have some work to do on the nav bar.

I am going to spend the rest of the afternoon/evening working on the "Interests" and "Resume" pages.

Today is day three of my portfolio build. I am committed to my layout now since I am basically halfway through my alotted time for this assignment. I think i have the basic structure of my home page how i would like it to look. I have filled out my "Interests" page and will spend this afternoon getting the "Resume" complete. 

I have had a bit of a hang up with my nav bar, but have a solution that is working as a place holder until I can get to class Monday to collab with some fellow students to make the bar move with the scroll.

Today is day four of my porfolio build. I have made some adjustments to my navbar/logo layout and I am much happier with how it looks/functions now. I plan to spend my Sunday debugging a couple small things regarding its functionality on the home page. 

I need to finish my Resume, Social Media, and Contact pages.

Today is day five of my portfolio build. I have made significant progress today on my contact page. I just need to get it to actually send me an email with the information provided by the user and it will be complete. 

I am satisfied with my functionality and layout, as far as deliverables go. But i would like to tweak it if time permits. 

I am going to continue to work on getting this contact page to work smoothly the rest of this afternoon.

I am having trouble figuring out how to make the contact page send me an email whenever the form submits

Today is day six of my portfolio build. I have fixed some bugs in my nav bar but have a couple left to figure out. I have a working contact page that takes a users input and automatically opens/fills out an email with there information provided on the contact page. 

I added a Projects section to my home page. I don't have projects to put in it yet, but this was a requirement, so they will be nice placeholders for later in class when we have done some more presentable projects.

I had some trouble getting the jquery implemented and working but i feel confident with this product.

Today marks our final day to finish up our portfolios. I am satisfied with my build, although i will continue to improve it as i learn more skills. 

My portfolio opens with an automatic modal pop-up welcoming you to my page with a picture i took of a squirrel. You then have the choice to click a button to close the modal and enter the portfolio site. You are greeted with a nav bar and my name followed by a picture of me on a hike. The rest of my home page consists of a section for my future projects, an about me section, and two more sections with links to my interests page and my resume page. I also provided links to my youtube channel, my github, and my linkedin. The footer of the page is a gif i use as a closer on my youtube videos. 

My additional pages include the interests page, resume page, and a contact page. The interests page and the resume page are straight forward information dumps as of right now, and the contact page includes a box for users to type out some information and upon submission, will be directed to there mail platform with an email already filled out with the information they put in on my page. 

The nav bar is formatted with my logo and a hamburger menu that, when clicked, will present links to other pages. I included my nav bar on every page excpet the contact page. The contact page only has a home button that takes you back to my main portfolio page. 

I hope to debug the issue i had with connecting the nav bar to the contct page, but for now i am satisfied with a home button. I also want to put some sort of interactive quality on the projects portion of my home page, maybe something that previews the projects on the page. 

I used @media to rearrange some of my home page to fit a better look for mobile/tablet/desktop views.
I implemented some JS/Jquery to make the nav bar functional and to make the contacxt form submit to the users email.

My style choices were made with meeting requirements in mind. I plan to refine and redefine the page in the future.
